# General Purpose

This is a presentation website for the Commons Hub Brussels, a community space / members club in the heart of Brussels.

People who visit the website should
- See the upcoming events and quickly filter them by tags
- Be able to book a room to organise a meeting or an event
- Get an idea of what the commons are
- Apply to become a member

It should convey that it is a vibrant space with a lot of things happening.

## Rooms

Rooms are defined in `settings.json`. Each room has a Discord channel from which we fetch images, and a booking form.

# Technically

This is a mostly statically generated website.
It updates once an hour by running a cronjob to fetch the latest data from the different data sources.

The only dynamic part is the ability to login with Discord to
- show your current balance
- feature photos
- remove photos that you posted or where you are tagged

## Build Process

The build process is separated from data fetching to support Docker volumes:

- `npm run build` - Compiles the Next.js application (does **not** fetch data)
- `npm run fetch-recent` - Fetches data for current and previous month, then auto-generates all aggregated files
- `npm run fetch-history` - Fetches all historical data, then auto-generates all aggregated files (run manually when needed)
- `npm run generate-data` - Manually regenerate all aggregated data files (images, contributors, transactions, events)

### Why Separate Build and Data Fetching?

When using Docker with mounted volumes, data fetched during the build process is lost when the container starts with the volume mount. Therefore:

1. **Build stage:** Only compiles the application
2. **Runtime stage:** Fetch data after container starts with mounted volume
3. **Empty data handling:** Website shows a helpful empty data state page with instructions

### Data Fetching

**Key Simplification:** Fetching data now automatically generates all derived data files (transactions, events, images, contributors), so you don't need to run separate generation commands.

The fetch scripts automatically skip months that already have cached data, so subsequent runs are much faster.

To fetch a specific month or date range:
```bash
npm run fetch-history -- --month=2025-01
npm run fetch-history -- --start-month=2024-01 --end-month=2024-12
```

### Empty Data State

When the data directory is empty or has no data, the website displays a helpful error page that:
- Explains why data is needed
- Provides copy-paste commands to fetch data
- Shows what will be fetched and how long it takes
- Links to full documentation

This is implemented in `src/components/empty-data-state.tsx` and checked on the homepage via `src/lib/data-check.ts`.

## Data sources
(defined in `settings.json`)
- Stripe
- Blockchain
- Discord
- Nostr
- luma
- ics calendars

## Data structure
All the data is saved locally in the DATA_DIR (default to ./data).

This folder is structured in a human readable and usable way:
data/:year/:month/:dataSourceType/:dataSource/:account.json

Data that contains sensitive information are always stored within a `/private/` directory. E.g. `data/{year}/{month}/calendars/luma/private/guests/eventId.json`

```

The build and cronjob fetch scripts automatically skip months that already have cached data, keeping operations fast and efficient.

## Data processing

We generate aggregated data to make it easier to generate the various different views (pages).

### Generated files per month (data/{year}/{month}/)

1. **transactions.json** - Aggregated financial transactions from all sources
   - Combines Stripe payments, blockchain transactions (Gnosis, Celo)
   - Normalized format with: date, amount, currency, counterparty, description, type, source
   - Used for financial reports and transaction history pages

2. **counterparties.json** - List of unique transaction counterparties
   - Extracted from all transactions
   - Includes names, types (person, organization, etc.)
   - Used for filtering and analytics

3. **events.json** - Consolidated events from all calendars
   - Merges Luma (ICS + API), Google Calendar, and other .ics sources
   - Includes metadata: title, description, dates, location, cover image, attendee count
   - Deduplicates events that appear in multiple sources
   - Fetches og:image for events without cover images

4. **discord/images.json** - All images posted in Discord for that month
   - Aggregates images from all configured Discord channels
   - Includes author info, timestamp, reactions, message context
   - Used for photo galleries and activity displays

### Global generated files (data/generated/)

1. **profiles/{username}.json** - User profiles
   - Generated for active contributors based on Discord activity
   - Includes display name, avatar, contribution stats, tokens received

2. **activitygrid.json** - Activity heatmap data
   - Shows contribution patterns by year/month
   - Used for activity visualization

3. **contributors.json** - Top contributors summary
   - Based on most recent 3 months of Discord activity
   - Includes contribution counts and token allocations

## Calendars

We support luma calendars and any .ics url.
We fetch automatically all entries and for each, we fetch the cover image or og:image.

## Image processing

There is an image proxy that on-demand resizes images and caches them in `data/tmp/`.

### Image sizes
- **xs**: 320px width
- **sm**: 640px width
- **md**: 1024px width
- **lg**: 1920px width

### Image proxy endpoints

1. **/api/image-proxy** - Proxies external images
   - Query params: `url` (required), `size` (optional: xs|sm|md|lg)
   - Example: `/api/image-proxy?url=https://example.com/image.jpg&size=md`
   - Caches resized versions as `{imageId}-{size}.jpg` in `data/tmp/`

2. **/api/discord-image-proxy** - Proxies Discord CDN images
   - Query params: `attachmentId`, `url`, `size`
   - Handles Discord's expiring URLs by re-fetching from message data
   - Example: `/api/discord-image-proxy?attachmentId=123&size=sm`

### Processing
- Uses Sharp library for image resizing
- Converts all images to JPEG (quality: 85)
- Maintains aspect ratio with "fit inside" strategy
- Never enlarges smaller images
- Cache duration: 24 hours

## Forms

All forms ask for the email address of the sender. Once sent, a confirmation email is sent to the sender using the RESEND api. 
A new thread in the "requests" channel is also created on Discord.

## Components

### ImageLightbox

A full-screen image viewer with navigation and social features.

**Responsibilities:**
- Display images in a modal dialog with full-screen view
- Navigate between images with keyboard (←/→), swipe gestures, or on-screen buttons
- Show image metadata: author, timestamp, message
- Support reactions (favorite/like) for authenticated users
- Allow image removal by author or admins
- Open original image in new tab

**Input:**
```tsx
interface ImageLightboxProps {
  images: ImagePost[]           // Array of images to display
  initialIndex?: number         // Starting image index
  showMessage?: boolean         // Show message text below image
  userMap?: Record<string, ...> // User info for display names
  channelMap?: Record<...>      // Channel names
  guildId?: string              // Discord guild ID for actions
}
```

**Output:**
- Renders a Dialog component with navigation controls
- Emits events when favorite/remove actions are performed
- Can be controlled via ref: `openImage(index)`

**Usage:**
```tsx
const lightboxRef = useRef<ImageLightboxHandle>(null)
<ImageLightbox ref={lightboxRef} images={images} />
```

### DiscordImageGallery

A responsive grid gallery of images from Discord messages.

**Responsibilities:**
- Display thumbnails in a responsive grid layout
- Load images through the image proxy with appropriate sizing
- Handle image loading errors with fallback to original URLs
- Open full-screen lightbox when thumbnail is clicked
- Show author avatar overlay on thumbnails
- Support different thumbnail sizes (sm, md, lg)

**Input:**
```tsx
interface DiscordImageGalleryProps {
  images: ImagePost[]            // Images to display
  showMessage?: boolean          // Show message in lightbox
  thumbnailSize?: "sm"|"md"|"lg" // Grid density
  userMap?: Record<...>          // User display names
  channelMap?: Record<...>       // Channel names
  guildId?: string               // For lightbox actions
}
```

**Output:**
- Renders a responsive grid of image thumbnails
- Opens ImageLightbox when thumbnail is clicked

**Usage:**
```tsx
<DiscordImageGallery
  images={images}
  thumbnailSize="md"
  showMessage={true}
/>
```

**Grid layout:**
- **sm**: 4-6-8 columns (mobile-tablet-desktop)
- **md**: 3-6 columns (default)
- **lg**: 2-4 columns
