/**
 * Membership identity.
 *
 * A member's id is a salted hash of their email address, minted by chb:
 *
 *     sha256(lowercase(trim(email)) + EMAIL_HASH_SALT)
 *
 * chb writes that id into every monthly members.json and uses it to name each
 * member's history file. This module reproduces the same hash so a signed-in
 * visitor can be recognised as the member they are, without the site ever
 * holding a list of member email addresses.
 *
 * The salt is the identity. It has to be byte-identical to the one chb syncs
 * with, and it must never be rotated: a new salt re-identifies the entire
 * membership, and nothing links the old ids to the new ones. It is deliberately
 * excluded from chb's mirror sync, so it is copied between hosts by hand.
 *
 * When EMAIL_HASH_SALT is absent this host cannot identify anybody, and the
 * whole membership surface stays off rather than degrading to something
 * half-working. See `membershipEnabled`.
 *
 * Member data is read only from chb's `restricted/` tree. Its `private/` tree
 * is never served under any condition — see `memberHistoryPath`.
